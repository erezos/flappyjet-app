# 📺 AdMob Real Ads Testing Guide

## 🎯 **WHAT WE IMPLEMENTED**

✅ **Real AdMob Integration** with your production IDs:
- **Android App ID**: `ca-app-pub-9307424222926115~5619528650`
- **Android Rewarded Ad**: `ca-app-pub-9307424222926115/8249350364`

- **iOS Rewarded Ad**: `ca-app-pub-9307424222926115/3324326745`

✅ **Smart Fallback System**:

- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when ads fail

✅ **Enhanced User Experience**:
- Preloading of ads for instant availability
